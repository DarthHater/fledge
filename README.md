{fledge} has been designed to streamline the process of versioning R
packages on *Git*, with the functionality to automatically update
`NEWS.md` and `DESCRIPTION` with relevant information from recent commit
messages. For details on usage and implementation, refer the [Get
Started](https://krlmlr.github.io/fledge/articles/fledge.html) article.

## Installation

Install from GitHub using

``` r
devtools::install_github("krlmlr/fledge")
```

## Usage

Run {fledge} commands from your package directory for versioning as
below.

  - To configure your package for the first-time with {fledge}, use
    
    ``` r
    fledge::bump_version()
    fledge::finalize_version()
    ```
    
    From now on, use bullet points (`*` or `-`) in your commit or merge
    messages to indicate the messages that you want to include in
    NEWS.md

  - To assign a new `"dev"` version number to the R package and update
    `NEWS.md`, use
    
    ``` r
    fledge::bump_version()
    fledge::finalize_version()
    ```

  - To assign a new version number to the R package before release to
    CRAN, use
    
    ``` r
    fledge::bump_version("patch")
    fledge::commit_version()
    ```
    
    Substitute `"patch"` by `"minor"` or `"major"` if applicable.

  - To add an additional bit to the commit message (like `[skip ci]` for use in CircleCI, etc...)
    CRAN, use
    
    ``` r
    fledge::bump_version("patch", "[skip ci]")
    fledge::commit_version()
    ```

  - To tag a version when the package has been accepted to CRAN, use
    
    ``` r
    fledge::tag_version()
    ```
    
    Call
    
    ``` r
    fledge::bump_version()
    ```
    
    to immediately switch to a development version.

  - To undo the last version bump, use
    
    ``` r
    fledge::unbump_version()
    ```
